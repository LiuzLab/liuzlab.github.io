Juliana is a PhD candidate in the Quantitative and Computational Biosciences program at Baylor College of Medicine. Her research focuses on developing computational methods to understand how polymorphic Alu elements contribute to rare disease pathogenesis. She specializes in building bioinformatics pipelines and applying machine learning approaches to identify pathogenic Alu-mediated variants that are missed by current diagnostic methods. Her work bridges computational genomics and clinical diagnostics, with the goal of improving molecular diagnoses for patients with rare diseases.
