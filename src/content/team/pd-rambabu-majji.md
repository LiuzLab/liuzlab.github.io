I am a **computational** biologist and bioinformatics postdoctoral associate in the Liu Lab, focusing on RNA sequencing–based analysis of gene regulation, including alternative splicing, alternative polyadenylation, and transcriptome-wide characterization of MeCP2-related mechanisms.[web:6][web:13][web:64][web:70]

My work combines large-scale genomic data processing, statistical modeling, and custom pipeline development to uncover how RNA-level changes contribute to neurological disease and aging-related phenotypes.[web:64][web:70][web:11]
